# CRS Seeker

## Note
This program uses `BeautifulSoup` for parsing CRS' HTML, make sure you have that (run `pip install bs4` if not).

## How to Use
```
git clone https://github.com/marshblocker/crs_seeker.git
cd crs_seeker
python crs_seeker
```
Then paste the HTML code of the webpage of the CRS pre-enlistment page of your chosen subject.

## Future Plan
Automatic retrieval of the target webpage HTML using `requests`.
